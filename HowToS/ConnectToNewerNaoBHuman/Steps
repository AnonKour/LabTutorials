In order to connect to the robot with ethernet in linux we must do the following steps:

1) Create a new ethernet connection and name it as you please.
2) In the IPV4 tab we set the method for the address to manual.
3) On the address field we add 192.168.3.20
4) On the netmask field we add 255.255.0.0
5) On the gateway field we add 10.0.3.0
6) Finaly the same we add on the DNS server and save it. [10.0.3.0] 
7) The we select it from the connections in order to use it.

Depending on the version the interface may vary.
Also depending on the team the third number, 3 in the above example, may vary as well but it cannot be 0.
